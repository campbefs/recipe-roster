## Description 
Do you love cooking but don't know what to eat? Or maybe you're not the most passionate about cooking, but just need a recipe to make for dinner. Whatever the case may be, you need to eat. Recipe Roster was created to help you find that perfect dish. A mash between pintrest and goodreads... for food - Recipe Roster is somewhere you can lookup recipes, post them to your profile, and share them with your friends/followers. You can follow other users to see what recipes they are trying, and even add comments and rating to their recipe posts to help decide what would be worth cooking.
