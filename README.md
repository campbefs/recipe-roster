  # Recipe Roster

  ## Description
  Recipe Roster is a recipe-sharing social media site to bring community to our kitchens. Users can search recipes using our handy search functionality, add recipes to their favorites and even follow friends to see what they are cooking. We've also given users the ability to rate recipes as a way to help others find the best recipes in a sea of possibilities. Users can also like and comment on recipe posts by other users to engage in a friendly dialogue about the cuisines.

  ## Installation
  To install locally, you can copy the git repository to your machine, run 'npm i' in the root folder, the server folder, and the client folder, and then run 'npm run develop' in the root folder. Users will need to have an instance of MongoDB running as the program uses the MERN stack.

  ## Usage
  Users must first login or create a new account. Once logged in, go to the 'search recipes' page in the dropdown to discovery new recipes. Users can then create post to add the recipe to their favorites list. Once a post is created it will follow up in the feed for any people that are following that user.  If you click on the post, users can rate the recipe, comment or like the post.
