## Description 
Do you love cooking but don't know what to eat? Or maybe you're not the most passionate about cooking, but just need a recipe to make for dinner. Whatever the case may be, you need to eat. Recipe Roster was created to help you find that perfect dish. A mash between pintrest and goodreads... for food - Recipe Roster is somewhere you can lookup recipes, post them to your profile, and share them with your friends/followers. You can follow other users to see what recipes they are trying, and even add comments and rating to their recipe posts to help decide what would be worth cooking. Follow the link below or follow our installation instructions to begin your recipe search today!
